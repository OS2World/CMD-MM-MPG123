- rew and ffwd changed to toggle mode
- added some trash buffers behaviors, making mpg123 latency less even with
  big buffers.
- the timer now show the time played, not decoded
- added MP3->WAV routines
- when buffers are trashed for rew and ffwd, the mpeg stream file position
  is brought to the file position that the decoder was at when it filled
  the currently playing audio buffer.
- max buffers locked to 200 and min to 5. these are 16KB buffers, and they
  seem like absolute limits anyway.
- much better rewind and fast forward (makes jumptosecs work a lot better too)
- reporting errors should be more reliable
- the timer now display to stderr, so -s works again.
